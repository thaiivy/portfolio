# portfolio

"Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?"

Answer:
I flipped between my Final Prototype from my UX class a lot and the code. I started by placing the basic building blocks there, then started to structure it, beginning mobile-first. Sometimes, development was difficult because of random roadblocks, so I had to narrow down the problem, go back to fix it, and continue again from there. This can be fustrating, but the satisfaction of figuring out the issue then finding the right solution to the puzzle is gratifying and reminds me again that I am still making steps towards an end result that I love. By creating my web portfolio, I've learned that sometimes, it's best to start a part again from basics, and though it may be overwhelming at times, to take it step-by-step.
